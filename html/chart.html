    <p>We asked thousand people to play with the game of Snake. This is good because we could make a chart of it to
      represent the average lenght of the game, and we could read out other data of it.</p>
     <p>For example we can see that only one play has been reach the game length of 160 at our chart. This is 0.1 percent
      of the games we recorded. So we can see it is not that easy as we could think before the game.</p>
      <p>As the game has increasing difficulty, the gamers can not get bored of it easely.
      But you can check out the datas by your own. Check the result of a these games.</p>
