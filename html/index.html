      <h1>Snake</h1>
      <p>The snake video game genre has so many things going in its favour, it’s no surprise that snake games remain incredibly popular. The snake game genre has its roots in a 1976 arcade game, called Blockade. This game was intended for two players, as both players would control their own snakes. The objective was to block the other player’s path, forcing them to crash into you.</p>
      <p>In 1997, Nokia developed Snake and included it on their Nokia 6110 phones. As Nokia was the largest cellphone brand in the 90s, with the Nokia 3310 selling 126 million units in the year 2000, the Snake game became synonymous with Nokia phones, even though Nokia included other games on their phones like Tetris and Space Impact.</p>
      <p>What makes the snake game genre so addictive is perhaps the very simple concept that game developers follow even today. A seemingly simple, casual game with pickup-and-play qualities becomes increasingly difficult, and the player’s objective isn’t simply to “win” the game, but to beat their last score. And of course, remember that Nokia’s Snake was before public leaderboards and online rankings.</p>
